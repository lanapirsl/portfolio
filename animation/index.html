            this project is where i finally got completely comfortable with the tools we were using - mostly adobe illustrator. yet again i was shown different approaches i used while developing my ideas that i hadn't previously, which opened up new directions i could go in. sketching out, planning and organizing really made coming back to the project and understanding it easy.

            after we were introduced to the process of animating, we connected the new fields and methods with our previous knowledge of css and javascript, further integrating them into our work and exploring them.</p>

            to be honest, this specific assignment was the easiest. it was a good refreshment exercise for buttons and events, but the biggest challenge was thinking of ten different animations.</p>

            <p><span class="keywords">project </span>pool was one of my favourite exercises in the whole semester. we had to but not just our knowledge, but understanding and perspective to test when choosing the projects. in the end, the more we understand the style and code behind a finished product, the less surprises we'll have when trying to replicate it.</p>

            i can confidently say that this was the most complicated assignment we've had so far, and exactly what we came here to study. it combined absolutely everything we learned up until that moment; group work, design, process, development, storytelling, interactivity, user experience, coding and presenting.

            we as a group worked on the story and goal together, but my role and what i did most was dealing with the code. it was a challenge to make everything work as planned, but it was an excellent learning experience.</p>
